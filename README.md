# GTA Image Converter

## Project Description

**GTA Image Converter** is a straightforward web application built on a Python backend using the Flask framework. Its primary function is to convert Snapmatic pictures from GTA 5 (images captured within the game) into the more universally compatible jpg format.

## Project Background

As an avid GTA 5 fan, I found myself captivated by the stunning in-game scenarios that begged to be captured through the in-game camera. However, the default format in which these images are saved, known as Snapmatic, posed a challenge for easy viewing and sharing. Unlike a simple file renaming solution, Snapmatic images required a dedicated conversion process to the widely supported jpg format.

## Key Features:

- **Web-Based Conversion:** The application provides a user-friendly web interface for effortless image conversion. Users can easily upload their Snapmatic images and receive the converted jpg files.

- **Flask Framework:** Leveraging the Flask framework, the backend of the application is robust and efficient. Flask ensures smooth communication between the user interface and the conversion logic.

- **Preserving Game Captures:** The GTA Image Converter plays a crucial role in preserving the captivating moments captured within the game, allowing users to seamlessly view and share their in-game photography.

## How to Use:

1. Navigate to the web application: [GTA Image Converter](https://gtaconvert.pythonanywhere.com/).
2. Upload your Snapmatic image.
3. Click the convert button.
4. Download your converted jpg image.
